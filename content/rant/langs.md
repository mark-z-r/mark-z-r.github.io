## Introduction

There are a lot of programming langauges out there, here's a few of them, 
and why I (dis)like them. If you disagree, great, I would love to hear your
opinion. This article is based on my experience. 

I have experience in: (ordered by most experience to least)
1. C++
    - My main programming langauge
    - I use C++26
2. TI-Basic  
    - TI-84 Plus CE
3. Lua
    - Configuration
    - Writing my own Lua config bindings 
4. Rust
5. C
    - Not much experience but I am still somewhat adept because of C++ experience
6. Typescript
    - BitBurner
7. Javascript
    - BitBurner
    - Web development
8. Python
    - A calculator I can't remeber the name of
9. Assemebly
    - So little experience that specifing which flavor or architecture is pointless
    - Fair amount of knowledge about the concepts involved with a CPU's operation
        
## Overview

### C++

C++ is derived from C, and as such shares many of the same traits.
- low-level
- performant

### C 

C is what Linux and Windows are written in. It is one of the most performant 
languages

## Comparisons
